**Need assistance implementing the 8-Puzzle problem solution in C++?**  
I’m here to guide you through solving this classic puzzle using the **Tiles out of Place** heuristic to find the shortest sequence of moves from an initial state to the goal state.

---

### ✅ **What You’ll Get**

#### **1. Understanding the 8-Puzzle Problem**
The **8-Puzzle** consists of a 3x3 grid where the goal is to move tiles from a shuffled initial state to the goal configuration. The blank space (denoted as "_") allows for sliding adjacent tiles. The problem involves using an algorithm to determine the sequence of moves required to reach the goal state from a given initial configuration.

#### **2. Using the Tiles Out of Place Heuristic**
The **Tiles Out of Place** heuristic is employed to measure the number of tiles that are not in their correct position compared to the goal state. This heuristic will help prioritize the states that are closer to the goal by guiding the search towards the least number of misplaced tiles.

#### **3. Designing the Solution Logic**
**Key Features:**
- **State Priority Queue:** Use a priority queue (S) to manage the states, prioritized by the number of misplaced tiles.
- **State Expansion:** For each state, generate all possible child states by sliding tiles, and push them into the priority queue for further exploration.
- **Goal State Check:** The algorithm will terminate when the goal state is reached, providing the sequence of states and the total number of steps.

#### **4. Implementation Steps**

##### **Step 1: Set Up the Initial State**
- **User Input:** The program will prompt the user to input the initial configuration of the 8-puzzle.
- **State Representation:** Each state is represented as a 1D array, and the puzzle board is displayed as a 3x3 grid.

##### **Step 2: Heuristic Calculation**
- **Tiles Out of Place:** Implement a function to calculate the number of misplaced tiles compared to the goal state. This number will be used as the priority for each state in the queue.

##### **Step 3: State Exploration**
- **Priority Queue Operations:** Use a priority queue to expand states based on their heuristic values. The algorithm will pop the state with the least number of misplaced tiles, generate its children, and insert them into the queue.

##### **Step 4: Sequence of Moves**
- **Track the Path:** As the algorithm progresses, keep track of the sequence of states leading to the goal.
- **Final Output:** Once the goal state is reached, output the sequence of states and the total number of steps required.

---

#### **5. Code Implementation**

- **Language:** C++  
- **Program Structure:** The C++ program will implement the priority queue, heuristic calculation, and state expansion.
- **Output:** Display the sequence of states and the total number of steps taken to reach the goal.

#### **6. Flowchart for 8-Puzzle Solution Design**

**Flowchart Steps:**
1. **Start** → Load Initial State → Display Puzzle Board
2. **User Input:** Enter Initial State → Initialize Priority Queue
3. **Repeat:** While Queue is Not Empty → Pop State → Calculate Heuristic → Expand Children → Insert Children into Queue
4. **Goal State Reached:** Display Solution Path → End
